  <h1>Learn How to Ask a Question</h1>
  <h2>A surprisingly challenging task</h2>
  <!-- Content here: -->

    <p>One of the most critical tools you will <i>ever</i> develop as a human being is the ability to formulate a question about a problem you're having. Many people incorrectly assume the most valuable piece of information to a question is its answer. But, even more valuable in the long-term is the path taken to find that answer. If you can figure out that path, you not only solve your current problem. You also guarantee a better outcome for any problems you will have in the future</p>

    <p>When learning programming, formulating a question about your problem is extra helpful because of the massive amount of software knowledge, advice, forums, tutorials, repositories indexed online! This is not true for every question, of course, but you can get pretty far on your own with a few well-placed search terms.</p>

    <p>In this lesson, we're going to discuss two aspects of asking a question:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>How to properly Google a problem and</li>
      <li>Once you've exhausted that option, how to formulate your question to someone else</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How to Google</h2>
    <p>A lot of people just starting in programming don't fully appreciate how much Googling even the most senior developers do <i>every day</i> in their jobs. No one can remember everything, particularly with the rapid pace of development. <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/65918/importance-of-learning-to-google-efficiently-for-a-programmer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As one commenter on Stackoverflow said:</a></p>

    <blockquote>I would rather be more knowledgeable at searching in general than knowledgeable about what I am searching for. If I am more efficient at searching, I can find anything. If I am more knowledgeable about a single subject, I am only good searching within that subject.</blockquote>

    <p>This cannot be emphasized enough. Even senior engineers use search engines to find answers to their software questions. And if senior devs do it, why wouldn't you?</p>

    <p>Here are some tips for using Google effectively to find an answer to your problem:</p>

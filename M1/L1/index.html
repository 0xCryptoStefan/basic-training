  <h1>Welcome to Basic Training!</h1>
  <h2>We promise it's much kinder and easier than the movies. </h2>

    <p>Starting to teach yourself programming can be difficult because there are a lot of small things you learn on the way to bigger things. A basic programming blog post assumes a non-trivial amount of existing knowledge. Sometimes, successfully completing the first step of a tutorial will require hundreds of tiny initial steps beforehand.</p>

    <p>It's not just online material, even university courses at elite institutions don't teach fundamental skills. We know this because MIT's Computer Science department has a course called <a target="_blank" href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/">"The Missing Semester of Your CS Education."</a> (we'll cite this often!)</p>

    <p>This is not only makes starting to learn programming hard, it also forces people to use fundamental tools poorly. If we learn a task only to accomplish another task, we'll typically only learn as much of the first task that gets us to the second. We learn the command line "good enough" to get the job done, but not the best way possible. And we certainly don't enjoy it! We compound the problem by continuing to use these essential tools in inefficient and sometimes agonizing ways.</p>

    <p>We built this mini-course to give a space to learn these fundamental tools in a deliberate, focussed way. We saw many people signing up for our Blockchain Frontend Bootcamp and having to learn these things while also trying to learn frontend developer and blockchain skills. This course hopes to pre-emptively help with many of the issues we've seen people struggle with over the years.</p>

    <p>Even if you're very familiar with the technology in these lessons, we encourage you to flip through them. Along with introductory material, we also have tips and tricks for optimizing and improving your use of these tools. After all, if you're staring at a code editor for hours, shouldn't it be tricked out in the best way possible? Who knows, what you learn here could make your developer experience a lot more fun!</p>

  <h2>A Few Things</h2>  

  <p>Luckily, to get comfortable you don't need to know that many things. It's just that they don't typically get explained together all at once.</p>

  <p>In this mini-course, we're going to go through five topics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Unix / Linux Operating Systems</li>
    <li>Command Line</li>
    <li>Code Editor</li>
    <li>Git</li>
    <li>Javascript / Node / Web Frameworks</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We will provide some material in these lessons, but we'll mainly be providing links to <i>other</i> places you can learn more. If you never left the mini-course, After completing it, you'll be able to find your way around a computer pretty well. However, please follow the links within a lesson to dive deeper, deepen your knowledge, and enhance your developer experience</p>

  <p>Let's get started!</p>

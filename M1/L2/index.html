  <h1>Learn How to Ask a Question</h1>
  <h2>A surprisingly challenging task</h2>
  <!-- Content here: -->

    <p>One of the most critical tools you will <i>ever</i> develop as a human being is the ability to formulate a question about a problem you're having. Many people incorrectly assume the most valuable piece of information to a question is its answer. But, even more valuable in the long-term is the path taken to find that answer. If you can figure out that path, you not only solve your current problem. You also guarantee a better outcome for any problems you will have in the future</p>

    <p>When learning programming, formulating a question about your problem is extra helpful because of the massive amount of software knowledge, advice, forums, tutorials, repositories indexed online! This is not true for every question, of course, but you can get pretty far on your own with a few well-placed search terms.</p>

    <p>In this lesson, we're going to discuss two aspects of asking a question:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>How to properly Google a problem and</li>
      <li>Once you've exhausted that option, how to formulate your question to someone else</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How to Google</h2>
    <p>A lot of people just starting in programming don't fully appreciate how much Googling even the most senior developers do <i>every day</i> in their jobs. No one can remember everything, particularly with the rapid pace of development. <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/65918/importance-of-learning-to-google-efficiently-for-a-programmer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As one commenter on Stackoverflow said:</a></p>

    <blockquote>I would rather be more knowledgeable at searching in general than knowledgeable about what I am searching for. If I am more efficient at searching, I can find anything. If I am more knowledgeable about a single subject, I am only good searching within that subject.</blockquote>

    <p>This cannot be emphasized enough. Even senior engineers use search engines to find answers to their software questions. And if senior devs do it, why wouldn't you?</p>

    <p>Here are some tips for using Google effectively to find an answer to your problem:</p>

    <h3>The error message is your friend</h3>
    <p>When you hit a snag, almost always you'll get an error message. The error message is your ticket to success. Sometimes you can get an answer just pasting an error message into a search engine.</p>
    
    <p>Most likely, you'll have to doctor it a little bit. Take the error message below, which we get while using an Ethereum software tool called <a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/" target="_blank" >Truffle:</a></p>

    <img src="../../img/truffle-error-1.png" alt="A command line displaying an error from the Ethereum framework Truffle" srcset="">

    <p>This error has occurred because there is no port specified in the configuration file (don't worry if none of those words make sense). We don't know that yet, all we know is we have an error message.</p>

    <p>The first line of error says, <pre>Something went wrong while attempting to connect to the network. Check your network configuration.</pre> First, we want to strip out generic terms. This will help narrow the search. Let's remove <pre>Something went wrong while</pre> which leaves us with <pre>attempting to connect to the network. Check your network configuration.</pre> Let's stick with the last sentence <pre>Check your network configuration</pre>, as it's something we're being asked to check.</p>

    <p>Second, we're going to want to add to our search whatever piece of software or library we're using, to further specify our problem. So our search is <pre>Truffle check your network configuration</pre>.</p> Here's my results page:

    <img src="../../img/truffle-error-2.png" alt="First page of search results for 'truffle check your network configuration'">

    <p>The first site looks promising, as its Truffle softwares <i>documentation page.</i> A project's documentation page contains any and all known aspects of the project. When we click on that link, we get:</p>

    <img src="../../img/truffle-error-3.png" alt="Truffle configuration page with the answer to our problem circled in red">

    <p>Circled in red is an example of a perfect network configuration. If we check it against our misbehaving code, we will find our error.</p>

    <p>Note: all major browsers have <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools" target="_blank" >developer tools,</a> which include a console for error messages. If you're working on a website, that's a great place to find errors.</p>

    <p>This process is not necessarily intuitive and may take some time to learn. But after a while, you will develop a sense of the best words to use to search to get the best results. You'll also start to recognize websites that seem well-structured and informative.</p>

    <p>Most despairingly, typically solving one problem will lead to another problem surfacing. Take a deep breath and repeat the process on <i>that</i> problem. But be sure to remember the issues as they arise. The knowledge you gain from solving one problem on a project stands to benefit any future problems.</p>

    <h4>Stack Overflow</h4>

    <p>The generous and benevolent gods of the internet have given software developers a great gift. That is the elitist, snarky but nonetheless extremely smart community on the website Stack Overflow (sometimes abbreviated SO).</p>

    <p>A lot of journeys of software troubleshooting will end at Stack Overflow. Sometimes it might even be helpful to start your search within Stack Overflow itself. Regardless, you will become very familiar with this site.</p>

    <p>But sometimes all the searching in the world doesn't get you the answers you need. Or, sometimes you're not getting the expected behavior from your computer but there are no error messages, just your frustrated face. At that point, you need to ask someone for help. We'll show you the best way to do that in the context of programming.</p>
